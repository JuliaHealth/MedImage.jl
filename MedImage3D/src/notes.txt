---LOAD_AND_SAVE.JL---
Creation of MedImage objects from the MedImage struct, with the help of dicom and nift datasets, with attributes such as pixel_data, image orientation , image direction, pixel spacing and patient ID.
DIcom files with unique Instance Uid's need separate medical image object.
Dicom files with unique Instance UId's have their 2d pixel array data stacked from a list of files within the current directory, that share the same series Instance UID;
Standardisation of the function is set in such a way that the load function returns a vector of MedImage objects.
Stacking of 2d pixel data arrays into 3d pixel data arrays.
Saving function for implementation of functionality to write to multiple nifti files from an array of MedImage objects and save them.
Reduction in the passing of global variables so casually within functions that tend to tinker with them.


---BASIc_TRANSFORMATIONS.JL---
implementing functionality for the defined functions with the help of interpolator enum
functions for the implementation of Rotation, Cropping , Translation and Scaling.
